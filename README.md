# VRCFriends
A simple Windows WPF application for quickly seeing which of your friends are currently available on VRChat.

## Pre-requisites
The application was written in Visual Studio, built using .NET 9 and .NET Framework 4.8.1

In order to run the application, the application has been published as 'self-contained', meaning it should just run.

However, if you require any of the .NET Runtimes, you can acquire them from the following links:
* .NET 9 for Desktop - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0/runtime
* .NET Framework 4.8.1 - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net481
